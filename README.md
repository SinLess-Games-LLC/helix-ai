### Where Immersion and Dreams Come True

The journey of SinLess Games LLC commenced in February 2018, orchestrated by the visionary mind of Timothy A. Pierce. This pivotal
moment was ignited by a transformative conversation with a close roommate, where Timothy articulated his discontentment with the lack
of immersion in modern games. To this, his roommate responded with a profound challenge:
<br/>
<br/>

> **"Well, do something about it. You've identified a need in an industry. Now you have the power to fix it."** > <br/> <br/>
> — Anonymous
> <br/> <br/>
> Intrigued and inspired by this insight, Timothy took the mantle upon himself and embarked on the mission to create SinLess Games LLC.
> This fateful roommate would not only become a cherished friend but also a guiding light during the formative stages of the company.
> Determined, Timothy embarked on the meticulous process of completing the essential paperwork to establish an LLC. After months of
> diligent effort, SinLess Games LLC came into being.

With an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and the desire to bring his vision to life, Timothy enrolled in Full Sail University. He
recognized the need for equipping himself with the requisite skills to thrive in this realm. As he nears the culmination of his
academic journey, Timothy stands on the cusp of realizing his dreams.

### Crafting Immersive Experiences

SinLess Games is a testament to a commitment rooted in the creation of deeply immersive gaming experiences. Our unwavering dedication
fuels our daily pursuit to infuse the gaming industry with the vitality it craves. What lies at the core of our mission? It's simple:
games that captivate, engage, and enthrall. We're here to rectify a contemporary shortfall—while graphics have flourished,
storytelling has waned. Our resolve is to mend this fissure, to usher in an era where narrative brilliance coalesces with
cutting-edge visuals.

Gone are the days when games were merely a product of profit motives! In the bygone era, limited graphics compelled game creators to
weave captivating tales that retained player interest. Today, the landscape has evolved, yet the essence of storytelling has faded.
SinLess Games steps forward to rewrite this narrative. We strive to unravel intricate narratives, amplify the allure of immersive
gameplay, and even contribute to the very fabric of gaming technology.

create virtual worlds where players can escape the mundane and immerse themselves in extraordinary realms. Your feedback is the
compass guiding our journey, propelling us to refine our creations. We eagerly embrace novel ideas and innovative approaches to
elevate our games and software for you, the heart and soul of our fan base.

We invite you to join us in a realm where immersion reigns supreme, where games are not just diversions but transformative
experiences. Step into our world, where the pursuit of dreams becomes a reality. Welcome to the realm of SinLess Games, where
immersion and dreams come true!

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve Helix-Ai`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
